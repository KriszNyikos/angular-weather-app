### Task

- Choose any public REST or GraphQL API, like by ex. weather data  
- Create an angular component  
- Fetch the API data async, manipulate it by using RxJS, and wire it into HTML  
- Last but not least, add a search field to the page which filters the data  

#### Tips

- Design just has to be functional, not beautiful  
- While we are aware that many of these can be achieved by a component library, we would encourage not to use those to solve the main issues (e.g. filtering)
